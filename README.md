A Very Good Project created by Very Good CLI.

## Description
Interface between Firebase Core and Firebase Messaging which helps in managing FCM tokens and notifications permissions.

It makes the following assumptions:
1. Your app has a backend
2. Your backend allows for updating user token and deleting of a user token
3. Your backend stores FCM tokens associated with string-based user ID

### Tokens
1. onLogin: It will check when was the last time your backend was updated with an FCM token and update it if it was longer than configured token ttl
2. onLogout: It will remove token from backend on logout

### Storing user preference re: notifications and asking for permission
1. Calling getAppNotificationPreference:
- will return current permission status, unless no permission is set in which case it will
- ask user for permission (using native iOS/Android process)

2. Using setAppNotificationPreference enables user to switch off notifications without using the device native preferences
- this simply calls your backend to delete the FCM token


## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Fcm Token Manager you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Fcm Token Manager comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].
